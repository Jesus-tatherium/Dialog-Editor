# Dialog-Editor
### This is a personal project i did to simplify the creation of dialogues and explore Unity's Editor

For this project, i decided to organize it like Unity's animator, with "states" as dialogues and "sub state machine" as subdialogues, 
the user can link the nodes and easily view how the different choices affect the outcome of the dialogue.
The user can alos load and saveprojects, or a part of the dialogue itself to reuse it in another project.
I implemented features but i did not focus on accessibility, as it can easily be changed to fit specifications.
Features:
  Data: text
        multiple answers

  Node: creation
        duplication
        movement
        link
        
  View: zoom
        movement
  
  File: save project/dialogue
        load project/dialogue
        create new project/dialogue
        serialization of project/dialogue
        
  WIP(not present in this version):
